# UCSD - Useful Directives

A series of useful AngularJS directives for a PowerSchool environment including customizable date/time pickers, psQuery, and a more responsive and robust tooltip.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- project/ – All files needed for the plugin installation
- archive/ – Historical versions (ZIP format, dated)
- resources/ – (Optional) Dev-only tools or references

## ⚙️ Features

- Date Picker that works with specific input and output requirements for different powerschool contexts while maintaining a consistent user experience
- Time Picker that works with specific input and output requirements for different powerschool contexts while maintaining a consistent user experience
- Tooltip that accepts complicated html for detailed tooltips that follow the cursor
- A directive to force formatting on textareas for situations where clean text needs to be enforced.
- psQuery in an AngularJS wrapper with slightly cleaned up

## 🛠️ Development Notes

Created with AngularJS for a PowerSchool AngularJS/Jquery environment. To install, compress the contents of the project folder and install via PowerSchools Plugin Manager.

## 🧪 Future Features

- Might convert psQuery to use JS psuedo Classes for fun
- Any new directives I create that I find useful across multiple projects
